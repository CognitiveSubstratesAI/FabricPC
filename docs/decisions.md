# FabricPC design decisions log

Cross-cutting decisions for the Julia port of FabricPC. Per-file rationale lives
in code comments at the point it's made; this file captures decisions that span
the package. Append as we go; correct in place when a decision changes.

The broad architecture + phasing lives in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md); this log is for
the load-bearing per-decision rationale that accrues during the build.

## 1. v0 is autodiff-free (explicit-grad Gaussian PC); Enzyme deferred to Phase D

Date: 2026-06-01

Predictive coding's outer (weight) loop does NOT backprop through the inner
(inference) loop — both gradients are local. Upstream computes them by
`jax.value_and_grad` of node-local energy *by default*, but ships closed-form
explicit gradients (`LinearExplicitGrad`, GaussianEnergy):
- `self_grad = precision·(z − z_mu)`,  `gain_mod_error = error · f'(pre_act)`
- `input_grad[e] = −(gain_mod_error · Wₑᵀ)`
- `dW[e] = −(inputₑᵀ · gain_mod_error)`,  `db = −Σ_batch gain_mod_error`

**v0 ports the explicit path** for Linear/Identity/Skip/Residual. This avoids the
single biggest porting risk — Enzyme over closures returning struct-of-arrays aux
(`has_aux`) — for the entire minimal trainable graph. Enzyme (the Julia analog of
`jax.value_and_grad`) lands in Phase D as the generic fallback for non-linear /
transformer nodes, with the explicit path as its conformance oracle.

## 2. Standalone package — no dependency on NGCSimLib/NGCLearn

Date: 2026-06-01

FabricPC's Node/Edge/slot graph is a *parallel* abstraction to NGCSimLib's
Component/Compartment, not built on it (per the layered plan). FabricPC.jl
therefore has no NGC-stack dependency. Cross-stack composition (using NGCLearn
components as FabricPC nodes) is the deferred, optional Layer 3.

## 3. Batch-first layout (match upstream exactly)

Date: 2026-06-01

Arrays are `(batch, *node_shape)`; energies sum over all non-batch dims. Upstream
is batch-first (NHWC/NLC); we match it verbatim to minimize port divergence and
make shape-by-shape verification against the Python source direct. (NGCLearn is
also batch-first, so the stack is consistent.)

## 4. Ordered node container (inference is node-order-dependent)

Date: 2026-06-01

`forward_value_and_grad` accumulates `latent_grad` while iterating nodes in graph
order, relying on already-deposited downstream contributions. A `Dict` is
unordered in iteration — use an ordered structure (Vector of nodes + name→index,
or `OrderedDict`) and a deterministic topological `node_order`, or the PC
gradient assembly is wrong.

## 5. Immutable state via Accessors.jl; dtype discipline on z_latent

Date: 2026-06-01

`NodeState`/`GraphState`/`GraphParams` are immutable structs updated with
Accessors.jl `@set` (the analog of upstream's NamedTuple `_replace`). Only
`z_latent` carries a clamp's dtype (integer token indices on source nodes); every
other state field stays float so a Reactant-compiled inference carry is
type-stable. Port `_validate_clamp_dtypes` (reject int clamps on internal nodes).

## 6. muPC scaling is optional (scaling_config === nothing ⇒ identity)

Date: 2026-06-01

Per-edge scaling factors live behind `NodeInfo.scaling_config`; when `nothing`,
every scaling callsite is an identity no-op — so v0 (Phase B) runs before the
muPC module (Phase C) exists. Critical replicated semantic: edges into
non-variance-scalable slots are ABSENT from the scaling dicts, and callsites treat
a *missing key* as a no-op (NOT multiply-by-1.0), which preserves integer dtype on
embedding/token paths. (`scale_weight_grads` is the one exception — it uses
`get(k, 1.0)`.)

## 7. CI format job is pinned + diff-on-fail from day one

Date: 2026-06-01

NGCSimLib and NGCLearn both hit a cache-drift bug where `julia-actions/cache` +
unpinned `Pkg.add("JuliaFormatter")` restored an older formatter than local,
failing the format gate on clean code. FabricPC's CI pins JuliaFormatter to
=2.5.2, drops the cache in the format job, and prints `git diff` on failure — so
the format gate is reliable and self-diagnosing from the start.
